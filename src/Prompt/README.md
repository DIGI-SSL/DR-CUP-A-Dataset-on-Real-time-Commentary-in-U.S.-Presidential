|Commentary and Transcript Input <br/>(Label Prediction)|Commentary from a commentator regarding the U.S. presidential election.<br/>The transcript is included if available.|This is a commentary made by a commentator regarding the U.S. presidential election: {***commentary***}.<br/> This is the corresponding debate transcript: {***transcript***}. <br/>"***NO***" means no transcript is available.|

|Example<br/> (Label Planning)| In this experiment, the model receives only a transcript and must generate the appropriate commentary label based on the content of the transcript.|Commentary: {***Insert Commentary***}<br/>Transcripts: {***Insert Transcripts***}<br/>Label: {***Corresponding Label***}
