Commentary: It’s in some ways apt that an issue that has had relative bipartisan support and yet keeps eluding successive presidents -- including the two on the stage now -- was largely derailed when the moderators raised it.
Label:Commentator's Personal Opinion (Performance of the Contestants)
Transcripts: Look, the fact of the matter is that he’s dead wrong about he’s increased. He will increase the taxes on middle class people. I said I’d never raise the tax upon anybody making less than $400,000. I didn’t, but this tariff is 10% tariffs. Everything coming into the country. You know what the economists say? That’s going to cost the average American $2,500 a year more because they’re going to have to pay the difference in food and all the things that are very important.
Commentary: A question on how Trump would make childcare more affordable turned into a replay of earlier bickering on relations with the military, and who’s the worst president in history.

Commentary: Trump came into office with inflation at 2.5% in 2017, and the pandemic economic crash brought the rate down to almost zero. Annual inflation rose as the economy re-opened, and supply-chain constraints when the country roared back to life were an additional — and significant — catalyst.
Label:Commentator's Personal Opinion (Candidate Statements)
Transcripts: And he caused the inflation. He’s blaming inflation and he’s right. It’s been very bad. He caused the inflation and it’s killing Black families and Hispanic families and just about everybody. It’s killing people. They can’t buy groceries anymore. You look at the cost of food where it’s doubled and tripled and quadrupled. They can’t live. They’re not living anymore. He caused this inflation. I gave him a country with essentially no inflation. It was perfect. It was so good. All he had to do is leave it alone. He destroyed it with his Green New Scam and all this money that’s being thrown out the window. He caused inflation.
             There was no inflation when I became president. You know why? The economy was flat on its back, 15% unemployment. He decimated the economy. Absolutely decimated the economy. That’s why there was no inflation at the time. There were no jobs.
Commentary: It’s true that US air pollution has declined -- particularly levels of criteria air pollutants have declined, even under Trump’s watch. Levels of particulate matter that can worsen asthma and smog-forming compounds have dropped as a result of environmental regulations. But during Trump’s first term, his administration rolled back or eased many such safeguards.，Label:評論者個人opinion(關於候選者的言論)，Transcripts: We’re in a situation where the idea that he’s claiming to have done something that had the cleanest water. The cleanest water? He hadn’t done a damn thing for the environment. He pulled out of the Paris Peace Accord, Climate Accord. I immediately joined it because he took 1.5 degrees Celsius at any one point where there’s no way back, the only existential threat to humanity is climate change. And he didn’t do a damn thing about it. He wants to undo all that I’ve done.
Commentary: Biden says his administration is “still pushing hard” to get Hamas to accept a ceasefire and says the only munitions he has denied Israel are 2,000 pound bombs, which “don’t work well in populated areas.
Label:Key Summary
Transcripts: Number one, everyone from the United Nations Security Council straight through to the G7, to the Israelis and Netanyahu himself have endorsed the plan I put forward, which has three stages to it. The first stage is trade the hostages for a ceasefire. Second phase is a ceasefire with additional conditions. The third phase is the end of the war. The only one who wants the word to continue is Hamas. Number one, they’re the only ones standing out. We’re still pushing hard to get them to accept. In the meantime, what’s happened? In Israel, we’re fine. I said the only thing I’ve denied Israel was 2000 pound bombs. They don’t work very well in populated areas. They kill a lot of innocent people. We’re providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them.
Commentary: Trump returns to the subject of Ukraine and NATO and says the alliance was “going out of business” when he took office and starting pushing the countries to spend more on defense.
Label:Key Summary
Transcripts: The European nations together have spent 100 billion or maybe more than that less than us. Why doesn’t he call them and say you got to put up your money like I did with NATO? I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. The Secretary General of NATO said, “Trump did the most incredible job I’ve ever seen.” They were going out of business. We were spending, almost 100% of the money it was paid by us. He didn’t do that. You got to ask these people to put up the money. We’re over $100 billion dollars more spent and it has a bigger impact on them because of location, because we have an ocean in between.
Commentary: In the world of crypto, Bitcoin is pushing higher as the debate continues, climbing more than 1% to break past $62,000.
Label:Market Reaction
Transcripts:  And Nancy Pelosi, if you just watched the news from two days ago on tape to her daughter who’s a documentary filmmaker, they say, but she’s saying, “Oh no, it’s my responsibility. I was responsible for this,” because I offered her 10,000 soldiers of National Guard and she turned them down.
Commentary: “Currencies are reacting to the US presidential debate,” said Carol Kong, a currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.  Judging by the reactions so far, markets think President Trump is ‘winning’ the debate, she said.
Label:Market Reaction
Transcripts: And let me tell you about January 6th. On January 6th, we had a great border, nobody coming through, very few. On January 6th, we were energy-independent. On January 6th, we had the lowest taxes ever. We had the lowest regulations ever. On January 6th, we were respected all over the world, All over the world we were respected. And then he comes in and we’re now left at, we’re like a bunch of stupid people. What happened to the United States’ reputation under this man’s leadership is horrible, including weaponization, which I’m sure at some point you’ll be talking about where he goes after his political opponent because he can’t beat them fair and square.
              Look, he encouraged those folks to go up on Capitol Hill, number one. I sat in the dining room off in the Oval Office, he sat there for three hours watching, being begged by his vice President and a number of his colleagues on the Republican side as well, to do something, to call for a stop, to end it. Instead, he talked about these people being patriots and great patrons of America. In fact, he says he’ll now forgive them for what they’ve done. They’ve been convicted. He says he wants to commute their sentences and say that no, but he went to every single court in the nation, I don’t know how many cases, scores the cases, including the Supreme Court and they said, “No, no, this guy is responsible for doing what was done.” He didn’t do a damn thing, and these people should be in jail and they should be the ones who are being held accountable and he wants to let them all out. And now he says that if he loses again, such a whiner that he is, that there could be a bloodbath.
              The only person on this stage who’s a convicted felon is the man I’m looking at right now, and the fact of the matter is what he’s telling you is simply not true. The fact is that there was no effort on his part to stop what was going on up in Capitol Hill and all those people. Every one of those who were convicted, that turned over desks, throwing them over statues. The idea that those people are patriots, come on. When I asked them in the first two debates we had, the debates we had first time around. I said, will you denounce the Proud Boys? He said, “No. I’ll tell them to stand by.” The idea he’s refusing, will you denounce these guys? Will you denounce the people we’re talking about now? Will you denounce the people who attacked the Capitol? What are you going to do?
              Well, I said my retribution is going to be success. We’re going to make this country successful again, because right now it’s a failing nation. 
Commentary: Hunter Biden on June 11 was was found guilty on three counts of violating federal gun laws for illegally checking a box on a form stating that he wasn’t an active drug user at the time he bought the firearm.
Label:Fact-checking
Transcripts: My retribution is going to be success, but when he talks about a convicted felon, his son is a convicted felon at a very high level. His son is convicted, going to be convicted probably numerous other times, should have been convicted before, but his justice department let the Statute of Limitations lapse on the most important things, but he could be a convicted felon as soon as he gets out of office.
Commentary: NEW: Two sources familiar with the situation say “President Biden  has a cold.”
Label:Fact-checking
Transcripts: There’s nothing to debate. He made up the Charlottesville story. And you’ll see it’s debunked all over the place. Every reasonable actor has debunked it. And just the other day it came out where it was fully debunked. It’s a nonsense story. He knows that and he didn’t run because of Charlottesville. He used that as an excuse to run.
              My retribution is going to be success, but when he talks about a convicted felon, his son is a convicted felon at a very high level. His son is convicted, going to be convicted probably numerous other times, should have been convicted before, but his justice department let the Statute of Limitations lapse on the most important things, but he could be a convicted felon as soon as he gets out of office.
Commentary: That’s probably because even though unemployment has been lower and economic growth has been better under Biden, the US economy performed better under Trump on standard-of-living indicators such as disposable personal income growth and inflation
Label:Commentator's Personal Opinion (Analyzing or Conclusions)
Transcripts: President Biden, inflation has slowed, but prices remain high. Since you took office, the price of essentials has increased. For example, a basket of groceries that cost $100 then now costs more than $120, and typical home prices have jumped more than 30%. What do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump?
              And so what we had to do is try to put things back together again, and that’s exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs, we brought out the position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs, but there’s more to be done. There’s more to be done. Working class people are still in trouble. I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come of a household where the kitchen table, if things weren’t able to be met during the month, it was a problem.
              Folks, how are you? Nice to be here, thanks.
              We got hit with COVID, and when we did, we spent the money necessary, so we wouldn’t end up in a great depression, the likes of which we had in 1929. By the time we finished… So we did a great job, we got a lot of credit for the economy, a lot of credit for the military and no wars, and so many other things. Everything was rocking good, but the thing we never got the credit for and we should have is getting us out of that COVID mess. He created mandates, that was a disaster for our country, but other than that, we had given them back a country where the stock market actually was higher than pre-COVID, and nobody thought that was even possible. The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce-back jobs to bounce back from the COVID. He has not done a good job, he’s done a poor job and inflation’s killing our country. It is absolutely killing us.
Commentary: If Trump wins again, it’s more than likely that European nations will be targeted once more, given that his advisers want the European Union to take a harder line with China on matters of trade and investment.
Label:Commentator's Personal Opinion (Analyzing or Conclusions)
Transcripts: I changed that, but the big thing I changed is they don’t want to pay. And the only reason that he can play games with NATO is because I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. I said, and he’s right about this, I said, “No, I’m not going to support NATO if you don’t pay.” They asked me that question, would you guard us against Russia at a very secret meeting of the 28 States at that time, nations at that time, and I said, “No, if you don’t pay, I won’t do that.” And you know what happened? Billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next months, but now we’re in the same position. We’re paying everybody’s bills.
              So they kill us on trade, I made great trade deals with the European nations because if you add them up, they’re about the same size economically, their economy is about the same size as the United States and they were… No cars, they don’t want anything that we have, but we’re supposed to take their cars, their food, their everything, their agriculture.
Commentary: Poll after poll shows voters believe the economy and their own financial situation was better under Trump than under Biden.

Commentary: Public support for abortion has inched up slightly since the Supreme Court overturned Roe in 2022. Currently, 63% of Americans say it should be legal in all or most cases, according to Pew Research Center. Some 85% of Democrats and 41% of Republicans say the same.
Label:Public Opinion
Transcripts: And now states are voting on it. And for the first time, you’re going to see… Look, this is an issue that’s torn our country apart for 52 years. Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, they all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote. And that’s what happened, happened.
              Well, I didn’t discuss it with JD in all fairness. And I don’t mind if he has a certain view, but I think he was speaking for me, but I really didn’t. Look, we don’t have to discuss it because she’d never be able to get it. Just like she couldn’t get student loans.
Commentary: That has become a fraught subject after his campaign faced an allegation that staffers were involved in an altercation with a cemetery official during a visit to Arlington National Cemetery. Trump was also criticized for taking a photo at a gravesite, which the former president said he did at the request of the family members he went to support.
Label:Commentator's Personal Opinion (Other)
Transcripts: And if she becomes president, this country doesn't have a chance of success. Not only success. We'll end up being Venezuela on steroids.
              They never fired one person. They didn’t fire anybody having to do with Afghanistan and the Taliban and the 13 people whose were just killed viciously and violently killed. And I got to know the parents and the family. They didn’t fire… They should have fired all those generals, all those top people because that was one of the most incompetently-handled situations anybody has ever seen.
Commentary: David Muir fact-checks Trump saying violent crime is down citing the FBI, after Trump claims crime is “through the roof.” Trump claims without evidence the statistics are fraudulent.
Label:Commentator's Personal Opinion (Other)
Transcripts: The FBI, they were defrauding statements. They didn’t include the worst cities. They didn’t include the cities with the worst crime. It was a fraud. 
Commentary: Investors will be assessing the likelihood of a Donald Trump victory, which if coupled with a Republican-controlled Congress, is expected to see a surge in Treasury yields and a boost to the greenback.
Label:Commentator's Personal Opinion (Market Performance)
Transcripts: "It’s been a terrible thing what you’ve done. The fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported Roe when it was decided, supported Roe. And this idea that they were all against it, it’s just ridiculous. And this is the guy who says the states should be able to have it. 
              The idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying, “We’re going to turn civil rights back to the states. Let each state have a different rule.”"
              That’s the last… No politician should be making that decision, a doctor should be making those decisions. That’s how it should be run, that’s what you’re going to do. And if I’m elected, I’m going to restore Roe v. Wade.
              So that means he can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth, because some states, Democrat-run, take it after birth.
              You’re lying, that is simply not true. Roe v. Wade does not provide for that, that’s not the circumstance. Only if a woman’s life is in danger, she’s going to die, that’s the only circumstance when that can happen. But we are not for late-term abortion, period. Period, period.
              I have to say this is embarrassing not just for @POTUS Biden but also for our country.
Commentary: Key Asian currencies are already testing multi-year lows against the dollar, with the won falling toward the key 1,400 level, while the yen this week blew past a threshold where officials intervened in the market in April. This will up the risk of currency intervention from South Korea and Japanese authorities.

Commentary: The rules called for cutting off a candidate’s microphone when his allotted time expired and so far, CNN has cut off Trump’s mic at least once as he kept talking.

Transcripts: And I want to close tonight's debate with the question posed by Brecklyn Brown. She's an eighth grader at Springville Junior High in Springville, Utah, and here's what she wrote.
Commentary: Does this presentation of Trump’s record move them at all?
Label:Commentator's Question
Transcripts: I started following the news when I was very young. And in America, we believe in a free and open exchange of debate. And we celebrate that as how we could, literally, the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world. And I will tell you that –don't assume that what you're saying on your local news networks is synonymous with the American people. 
              And here in America, we can disagree we can debate vigorously as Senator Harris and I have on the stage tonight. But when the debate is over, we come together as Americans.
              You know, I looked at the relationship between Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the late justice who we just lost from the Supreme Court, and the late Justice Antonin Scalia. They were on polar opposites, on the Supreme Court of the United States – one very liberal, one very conservative. But what's been learned since her passing was the two of them and their families were the very closest of friends.
              Joe Biden – one of the reasons that Joe decided to run for president, is after Charlottesville, which we talked about earlier, it so troubled him and upset him, like it did all of us, that there was that kind of hate and division. What propelled Joe to run for president was to see that, over the course of the last four years, what Brecklyn described has been happening. Joe has a long standing reputation of working across the aisle and working in a bipartisan way.
Please respond with the most likely label.
