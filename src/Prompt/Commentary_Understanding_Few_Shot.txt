Label: Commentator's Personal Opinion (Performance of the Contestants)

Commentary: "A question on how Trump would make childcare more affordable turned into a replay of earlier bickering on relations with the military, and who’s the worst president in history."

Commentary: "Trump came into office with inflation at 2.5% in 2017, and the pandemic economic crash brought the rate down to almost zero. Annual inflation rose as the economy re-opened, and supply-chain constraints when the country roared back to life were an additional — and significant — catalyst."
Label: Commentator's Personal Opinion (Candidate Statements)

Commentary: "It’s true that US air pollution has declined -- particularly levels of criteria air pollutants have declined, even under Trump’s watch. Levels of particulate matter that can worsen asthma and smog-forming compounds have dropped as a result of environmental regulations. But during Trump’s first term, his administration rolled back or eased many such safeguards."
Label: Commentator's Personal Opinion (Candidate Statements)
