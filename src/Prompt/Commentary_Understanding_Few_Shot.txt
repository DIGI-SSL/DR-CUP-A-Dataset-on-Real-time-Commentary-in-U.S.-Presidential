Transcript: NO
Commentary: "Trump came into office with inflation at 2.5% in 2017, and the pandemic economic crash brought the rate down to almost zero. Annual inflation rose as the economy re-opened, and supply-chain constraints when the country roared back to life were an additional — and significant — catalyst."

Commentary: "It’s true that US air pollution has declined -- particularly levels of criteria air pollutants have declined, even under Trump’s watch. Levels of particulate matter that can worsen asthma and smog-forming compounds have dropped as a result of environmental regulations. But during Trump’s first term, his administration rolled back or eased many such safeguards."

Commentary: "Biden says his administration is 'still pushing hard' to get Hamas to accept a ceasefire and says the only munitions he has denied Israel are 2,000-pound bombs, which 'don’t work well in populated areas.'"
Label: Key Summary
Transcript: "Number one, everyone from the United Nations Security Council straight through to the G7, to the Israelis and Netanyahu himself have endorsed the plan I put forward, which has three stages to it. The first stage is trade the hostages for a ceasefire. Second phase is a ceasefire with additional conditions. The third phase is the end of the war. The only one who wants the word to continue is Hamas. Number one, they’re the only ones standing out. We’re still pushing hard to get them to accept. In the meantime, what’s happened? In Israel, we’re fine. I said the only thing I’ve denied Israel was 2000-pound bombs. They don’t work very well in populated areas. They kill a lot of innocent people. We’re providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them."

Label: Key Summary
Transcript: "The European nations together have spent 100 billion or maybe more than that less than us. Why doesn’t he call them and say you got to put up your money like I did with NATO? I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. The Secretary General of NATO said, 'Trump did the most incredible job I’ve ever seen.' They were going out of business. We were spending, almost 100% of the money it was paid by us. He didn’t do that. You got to ask these people to put up the money. We’re over $100 billion dollars more spent and it has a bigger impact on them because of location, because we have an ocean in between."
